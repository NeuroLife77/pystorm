"""
Utils module

Contains the complete set of utility functions that improve quality of life.

Currently contains: minitorch (also available as 'mnt')

Minitorch is already available through pystorm import (along with its mini-name 'mnt') so it is not necessary to import through here unless you want to import some of its functions directly without importing minitorch.
